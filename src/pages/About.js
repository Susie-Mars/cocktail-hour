        Hi, my name is Susie Mars and I'm a developer based in Denver, CO with
        an affinity towards ReactJS and all things front-end. Like literally
        everyone else in the known universe, when looking for recipes, I hate
        reading the entire life story of the author before getting to the good
        stuff. I also feel like there are 5000 websites dedicated to food
        recipes and very few, if any, dedicated purely to cocktail recipes.
        Thus, I created Cocktail Hour. Using The Cocktail DB API, ReactJS, HTML,
        CSS, and Bootstrap, I created this simple site for users to search
        cocktail recipes based on name. Hope you enjoy! Drinks on me!
